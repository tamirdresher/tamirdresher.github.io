It finally happened. Microsoft shutdown its blog hosting platform that i was using for years [http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/iblogger/](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/iblogger/).
At least now i got the change to work with a modern platform for hosting my blog - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) it allows me to and author posts with Markdown and it's super easy to work with.
