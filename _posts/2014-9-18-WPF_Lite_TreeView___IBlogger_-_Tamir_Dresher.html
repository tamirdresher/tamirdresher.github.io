<DIV class="contx entry-content clearfix"><P>I received a call from a client last week about bad performance in their WPF application. It turns out that they expected that some view that holds a tree will need to show a few tens of items BUT when they deployed it to customer site they were surprised that the amount of items was actually a few thousands.</P>
<P>Long story short – WPF TreeView doesn’t scale very good, trying to expand a node with thousands of sub-items can take a long time. Virtualization doesn’t work either (especially if you work with .NET framework prior to 4.5) because it makes the tree jumpy and the scrollbar out of sync.</P>
<P>So finally I created a TreeView replacement that uses extends ListBox&nbsp; and gives the simulation of a TreeView:</P>
<P>1. Expanding an item adds the sub items to inner items-list<BR>2. Collapsing an items removes the items from the inner items-list</P>

<P>The code in on GitHub so take a look: <A href="https://github.com/tamirdresher/WPFLiteTreeView">https://github.com/tamirdresher/WPFLiteTreeView</A></P>
<P>And use the Nuget package: <A href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/WPFLiteTreeView/">Install-Package WPFLiteTreeView</A></P><IFRAME style="BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; OVERFLOW: hidden; BORDER-LEFT-STYLE: none; HEIGHT: 80px; BORDER-BOTTOM-STYLE: none; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/WPF Lite TreeView _ IBlogger - Tamir Dresher_files/like.html" frameBorder=0 allowTransparency scrolling=no></IFRAME></DIV>
