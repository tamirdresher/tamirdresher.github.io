I get asked this question at every conference: **"What's your actual stack?"**

Not the aspirational stack. Not the "I tried this once at a hackathon" stack. The one that's running right now, on my machine, making my AI squad work while I sleep.

Here's the honest answer — every tool, why I chose it, and what I'd change. Fair warning: I have opinions, and some of them are expensive.

## The Foundation: Where Code Lives

### GitHub + GitHub Copilot CLI

Everything starts here. My AI squad — seven specialized agents — lives in a GitHub repo. Issues are the task queue. PRs are the delivery mechanism. [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot) is the orchestration layer that makes the whole system possible.

**Why Copilot CLI specifically?** Because it's the only tool I've found that lets me give a team of AI agents their own persistent context, memory, and specializations. Each agent has a charter. They remember past decisions. They route work based on expertise. It's basically a standup meeting that runs every five minutes, except nobody's late and nobody's eating cereal on mute.

**Cost:** GitHub Copilot Business — $19/month per user. For what I get out of it? Absurdly underpriced.

👉 [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) — Try the CLI, not just the IDE integration.

### JetBrains Rider — My .NET IDE

I know VS Code is free. I know it has great extensions. But for serious .NET development — the kind where I'm debugging async state machines, profiling memory allocations, and navigating a 200K-line codebase — Rider is unmatched. Yes, I tried going back to VS Code twice. I lasted about 72 hours each time.

What Rider gives me that VS Code doesn't:
- **Built-in decompiler** — When a NuGet package does something weird, I read the IL
- **Database tools** — SQL Server, PostgreSQL, in the same window
- **dotMemory/dotTrace integration** — Profile without leaving the IDE
- **Structural search** — Find patterns across the whole codebase, not just text

**Cost:** $149/year (individual). Worth every penny.

I've also used [AFFILIATE:jetbrains:ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/?JETBRAINS_AID) for years when I'm in Visual Studio — the refactoring tools alone save hours per week.

## The AI Layer

### GitHub Copilot (IDE + CLI)

Two different products, both essential:

- **Copilot in IDE:** Autocomplete, chat, code review. You know this already.
- **Copilot CLI:** This is the game-changer. Terminal-based agent orchestration. Persistent sessions. Custom agent personas. This is what runs my AI squad.

The CLI is what lets me say "Team, build the user search feature" and have four agents work in parallel — one on the API, one on docs, one on security review, one on deployment config. It's like pair programming, if your pair was actually seven people and none of them needed coffee breaks.

👉 [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

### Azure OpenAI Service

For custom AI integrations beyond Copilot. When I need fine-tuned models, custom embeddings, or high-throughput inference, Azure OpenAI gives me enterprise-grade access with the security controls Microsoft requires.

**Key advantage:** Data stays in your Azure tenant. No training on your data. Enterprise compliance baked in.

👉 [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### Azure (Multiple Services)

My AI agents don't just write code — they manage infrastructure. Here's what I actually use:

- **Azure DevBox** — Cloud development environments with GPU access. Essential for voice cloning experiments (don't ask, or actually, do — it's in [the blog series](/blog/series/scaling-ai)).
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** — Production workloads via the DK8S platform.
- **Azure DevOps** — Pipelines, work tracking, artifacts. Integrated with Squad via MCP servers.
- **Azure Static Web Apps** — Blog hosting with GitHub Actions deploy.

👉 [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) — Start with $200 credit.

### Docker + Kubernetes

Every agent's work is reproducible. Docker containers for local dev, Kubernetes for production. Helm charts for deployment. ArgoCD for GitOps. If you can't reproduce it, it didn't happen.

---

## Writing & Documentation

### Markdown + GitHub

All documentation lives in the repo. Blog posts are markdown files. The book manuscript is markdown. Agent charters are markdown. Everything is version-controlled, diff-able, and PR-reviewable. I once tried Notion. The merge conflicts made me question my career choices.

### Grammarly

Even AI-assisted writing needs proofreading. Grammarly catches the things spell-check misses — tone, clarity, passive voice. It's humbling how often my "brilliant" prose turns out to be a run-on sentence with four dangling modifiers.

## The "Secret Weapons" — Tools Most People Skip

### BenchmarkDotNet

If you're writing performance-sensitive .NET code and you're not benchmarking with [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/), you're guessing. My Worf agent runs micro-benchmarks on every hot-path change. The number of times a "trivial optimization" turned out to be a 3x regression is... embarrassing.

### MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)

The glue that connects my AI agents to external systems. Outlook, Azure DevOps, Teams, GitHub — all accessible through MCP servers. This is how Ralph reads the issue queue and Kes schedules meetings. If agents are the brain, MCP is the nervous system.

### dotnet-trace + PerfView

For production performance issues, nothing beats `dotnet-trace` for lightweight sampling and PerfView for detailed analysis. My squad has a dedicated skill for diagnosing .NET perf problems. It's like having an on-call performance engineer who never sleeps and doesn't bill $400/hour.

## The Books That Shaped My Thinking

If you want to understand the architecture behind AI agent systems, these are the books I keep coming back to:

📚 [AFFILIATE:amazon:Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373321?tag=AMAZON_TAG) by Martin Kleppmann — The distributed systems bible. Understanding eventual consistency and event sourcing is critical for multi-agent coordination.

📚 [AFFILIATE:amazon:The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0135957052?tag=AMAZON_TAG) by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt — Still relevant after all these years. The "don't repeat yourself" principle applies to AI agent charters too.

📚 [AFFILIATE:amazon:Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492034029?tag=AMAZON_TAG) by Sam Newman — Agent teams ARE microservices. Same patterns: independent deployment, clear interfaces, eventual consistency.

📚 [AFFILIATE:manning:Rx.NET in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rx-dot-net-in-action?a_aid=8ec75026&a_bid=BANNER_ID) by Tamir Dresher (yes, me — I'm allowed to recommend my own book, right?) — Reactive programming patterns are the foundation of event-driven agent systems. Ralph's 5-minute watch loop is essentially an observable sequence with backpressure handling.

📚 [AFFILIATE:amazon:AI Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098166302?tag=AMAZON_TAG) by Chip Huyen — The production readiness guide. Essential for taking agents from "cool demo" to "running at 3am without waking anyone up."

## What I'd Change

If I started from scratch today:

1. **Start with Copilot CLI from day one.** I wasted months with custom orchestration before discovering Squad. Months. Of my life. That I'll never get back.
2. **Invest in Rider earlier.** The productivity gap vs VS Code widens as your codebase grows.
3. **Set up MCP servers immediately.** The integration surface area is what makes agents truly useful. An agent that can't read email or post to Teams is just a chatbot with delusions of grandeur.

---

## The Bottom Line

My stack isn't the cheapest. GitHub Copilot + Rider + Azure adds up to maybe $100-200/month. But the ROI is absurd: my AI squad ships code while I sleep, catches security issues I'd miss, and documents everything automatically. The tools pay for themselves in the first week.
